print(5/8)

#Addition works too
print(7+10)



#Python as a calculator
#basic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
#advanced: exponentation - **, % - returns reminder,  

#addition and subtraction
print(3-5)
print(3+5)

#multilication and division
print(3*5)
print(3/5)

#exponentiation
print(4**2)

#modulo
print(4%3)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*(1.1**7))



#Variable Assignment
#a varibale allows you to refer to a value with a name
#create a variable savings
savings=100
#print out savings
print(savings)


#Calculation with variables
factor=1.1
#calculate result
result=savings*(factor**7)
print(result)

#define int
#integer, a number without frational part
#define float
#floating point, a number has both an integer and fractional part

#other common data types
#str
#string, a type to represent text
#compound interest
desc='compound interest'

#bool
#boolen, a type to represent logical values
profitable=True

#type
print(type(profitable))



#Operations with different types
year1=savings*factor
print(type(year1))

#sum of two strings
dou_desc=desc+desc
print(dou_desc)


#Convert Types of Variables
#convert python values into any type
#str() --- convert a value into string
#similar: int(), bool(), float()

#example of type convert
print("I started with $"  + str(savings) + ". Now I have $" + str(result))
